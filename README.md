# SVG Emoji 2
SVG Emoji 2 is a _going_ to be a better version of the original SVG Emoji. Emoji's are going to change their appearence. Bugs are going to be fixed. There is no prommise that this will be a success, as the original SVG Emoji ran against unexpected bumps in it's path and we thought if we started from scratch we could make it better. Once again this is no prommise and this is not stable yet. We are testing and creating the code/emoji's whenever we can. Stay tuned for more updates.
